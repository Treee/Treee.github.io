                  A commonly requested DayZ feature is camo face paint for blending into the backround environment. Prior to my workshop mod the only server to showcase this awesome feature was

                  A quick rundown of the work. Each player model has a texture that represents what is wrapped around the model and with over 31 individual player models, retexturing for each camo pattern turns into a
                  massive amount of 4k images; male models have 4 textures each to account for beard lifespans which we will touch on later. I wanted to add over 25 face paint patterns so keeping the total size of the
                  mod down was important. In DayZ's engine, Enfusion, the RVMAT or material file contains the processing steps during rendering. Fortunately for us, the third stage, MC or
                  <a class="post-author" href="https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Super_shader#3._Macro_map" target="_blank">Macro Map</a> gives us the option to overlay additional texture data onto the basic texture.
                  This forms the foundation of me using a single MC file for each camo pattern for all character models thus allowing me to only have to write custom RVMAT files, which are considerably smaller instead of
                  4k textures. This reduces the modpack by 90%; from roughly 300MB+ to 30MB+.

                  There is a hidden gotcha within DayZ for modders that wish to modify player model textures, beards. The lifespan for a beard is check on a network sync which looks at how long the player has gone
                  without shaving and will reset the current face texture regardless of state. For female models there are no beards and they do not even have calls to this system at runtime so their solution has to come
                  separately. Ultimately, I overrode the player Lifespan to check for the existence of any camo patterns applied, if so, apply the custom
                  <a class="post-author" href="https://github.com/Treee/ItsATreeeDayZWorkshopMods/blob/master/Survivalists_FacePaints/heads/fp_bulgaria1/hhl_f_helga_body.rvmat" target="_blank">RVMAT</a> I created. If the
                  model is female, the face texture is simply overriden. The item that applies the face paint is an existing epinephrine pen repurposed to scroll through pattern options then click and hold to apply. Rags
                  were also given actions to wash a players face to remove the paint which sets the current camo pattern to -1 and indicates no pattern applied so the default DayZ systems reset the face material.

                  For over two years my free time development efforts have helped support The Survivalists community to grow it into the #1 Roleplay server within DayZ at the time of this writing (Summer 2022). Building
                  content and balancing the game to meet the needs of the community presents an awesome challenge of balance. Players have an insatiable appetite for content and progression whereas my time and velocity
                  of release are finite. Prioritizing work that yields more "Fun" is important when managing a content release cycle for a large community. Our server runs on a bi-weekly update schedule with major
                  releases happening on the first and third weeks and minor releases on second and fourth weeks. This allows us to be agile with feedback from the community and helps build an expected cadence for content
                  or bug fixes. One awesome byproduct of making cool stuff with mods is other people want to learn how to make cool stuff as well. Within the community discord we have a a channel dedicated to helping
                  others learn how to take their first steps on the modding journey which has yielded several new server devlopers who contribute their content to the server modpack.
